# 💾 Points Persistence System

## ✅ **System Status: ACTIVE & WORKING**

Your Vouchy bot now has a **bulletproof persistent storage system** that ensures points are **never lost** during updates, restarts, or redeployments.

## 🗄️ **How It Works**

### **Storage Location**
- **Primary File**: `/app/data/points.json` (Railway persistent volume)
- **Backup File**: `/app/data/points-backup.json` (automatic redundancy)
- **Emergency Backup**: `/app/data/points-emergency.json` (if primary fails)

### **Auto-Save Features**
- ✅ **Immediate Save**: After every vouch, bet, or point transaction
- ✅ **Periodic Save**: Every 5 minutes (auto-backup)
- ✅ **Dual Storage**: Main + backup files for redundancy
- ✅ **Recovery System**: Automatic restoration from backup if main file corrupts

### **Backup System**
```
Points Transaction → Save to Main File → Save to Backup File → Success ✅
                      ↓ (if fails)
                  Emergency Backup → Log Error → Continue Operation
```

## 🧪 **Testing Your System**

### **1. Test Points Persistence**
```bash
npm run test-persistence
# or on Railway:
railway run npm run test-persistence
```

### **2. Manual Backup Command**
Use `/backup` in Discord (Admin only) to:
- Force save all points
- View storage statistics
- Check file integrity
- See total users and points

### **3. Verify Persistence**
1. Add some points to users
2. Use `/backup` command
3. Redeploy bot: `railway up --detach`
4. Check points are still there with `/points` or `/leaderboard`

## 📊 **System Features**

### **🔄 Auto-Recovery**
- If main file corrupts → loads from backup
- If backup exists but main missing → restores main from backup
- Comprehensive error logging for troubleshooting

### **📈 Monitoring**
- Real-time logging of all save operations
- File size and modification time tracking
- User count and total points statistics

### **🛡️ Redundancy**
- **3 backup levels**: Main file, backup file, emergency backup
- **Multiple save triggers**: Transaction, periodic, manual
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation if storage fails

## 🚀 **Commands for Managing Storage**

### **For Admins**
```
/backup              - Manual backup + storage info
/addpoints <user> <amount> - Add/remove points (auto-saves)
```

### **For Testing**
```bash
npm run test-persistence     - Test storage system
npm run clear-points        - Start completely fresh
railway run npm run test-persistence  - Test on Railway
```

### **For Deployment**
```bash
railway up --detach         - Deploy (points persist automatically)
railway logs               - Check storage logs
```

## 📋 **What You'll See in Logs**

### **Successful Storage**
```
💾 Points saved successfully to /app/data/points.json (5 users)
🔄 Auto-saved 5 user points
💾 Created backup at /app/data/points-backup.json
```

### **Recovery Operations**
```
✅ Loaded 5 user points from /app/data/points.json
🔄 Found backup file, restoring...
✅ Loaded 5 user points from backup
🔄 Restored main points file from backup
```

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

1. **Never Delete `/app/data`**: This is your persistent volume
2. **Points Auto-Save**: No manual saving needed
3. **Railway Volume**: Configured automatically via `railway.toml`
4. **Update Safe**: Points survive all deployments
5. **Backup Command**: Use `/backup` to verify system health

## 🎯 **Verification Checklist**

Before and after each update, verify:

- [ ] Bot starts successfully (`railway logs`)
- [ ] Points load on startup (`✅ Loaded X user points`)
- [ ] Auto-save is enabled (`💾 Auto-save enabled`)
- [ ] Vouch detection works (test with image + provider mention)
- [ ] Gambling commands work (`/roulette`, `/blackjack`)
- [ ] Manual backup works (`/backup` command)

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Points Not Loading?**
1. Check logs: `railway logs`
2. Run backup command: `/backup`
3. Test persistence: `railway run npm run test-persistence`

### **Storage Errors?**
1. Volume mount may be missing
2. Check Railway volume configuration
3. Verify `/app/data` directory exists

### **Complete Reset (if needed)**
1. `npm run clear-points` (locally)
2. `railway up --detach` (deploy)
3. Points will start fresh but persist from that point
